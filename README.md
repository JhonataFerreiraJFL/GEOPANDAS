# GeoPandas Study Project

## Overview

This repository contains a project focused on studying and mastering GeoPandas, a Python library for working with geospatial data. The goal is to explore various functionalities of GeoPandas, including reading, manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing geographic data.

## Features

- Import and export of geospatial data in various formats (Shapefile, GeoJSON, etc.).
- Spatial data manipulation and analysis (e.g., buffering, merging, dissolving).
- Coordinate reference system (CRS) transformations.
- Spatial joins and overlays.
- Geospatial data visualization using Matplotlib and Folium.
- Integration with other libraries like Pandas, Shapely, and Fiona.

## Structure

- **data/**: Contains sample geospatial datasets used in the project.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step explanations and code for different GeoPandas functionalities.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for processing and analyzing geospatial data.
- **output/**: Generated outputs such as maps, charts, and processed datasets.
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies.
